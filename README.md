# ErenshorBankTabLabels
A simple mod for the simulated MMORPG Erenshor. It adds the possibility of naming your bank tabs to help you organize all the data you amass during your virtual travvels. ;-)
At first runtime it creates a config file with a list of all currently existing 98 bank tabs. You can edit the file and add names to each tab.

On the current master branch/release there is no way of modifying tab names inside the game, on the fly, but that's the next planned feature. I am also considering to add custom text color.
