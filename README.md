# ErenshorBankTabLabels
A simple mod for the simulated MMORPG Erenshor. It adds the possibility of naming your bank tabs to help you organize all the loot you hoard during your virtual travels. ;-)

**INSTALL GUIDE:**  
**Must have:** BepInEx.  
**Highly recommended:** BepInEx configuration manager.  
Download the .dll, put it inside Erenshor/BepInEx/plugins. Run the game. Profit.
At first runtime it creates a config file (com.Tingilinde.BankTabLabels.cfg) with a list of all currently existing 98 bank tabs. If you use config manager you can modify the tab names there, otherwise you must open the config file manually and modify the names there, then reload the game for your changes to take effect. The label should appear above the page number once you open your bank.

Roadmap (subject to change):
Ability to modify tabs during runtime even without config manager.
Configurable button to turn the mod on and off.
Custom text color for each tab.
Possibly text effects, just because. :P
